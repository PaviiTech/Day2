This project focuses on mastering basic data operations in SQL by practicing INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements using tools like DB Fiddle or SQLiteStudio. The objective is to populate a sample database while handling missing data using NULL values or default column settings. The task involves inserting meaningful rows, updating existing records using conditional WHERE clauses, and deleting specific entries â€” all while ensuring data consistency and integrity. This exercise is essential for understanding how to manage incomplete data, update selectively, and safely remove records. By completing this project, you gain confidence in writing real-world SQL queries that are clean, accurate, and aligned with industry practices.
